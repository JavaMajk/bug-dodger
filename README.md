# BUG DODGER
This old school style game has been created as a part of [Udacity Web Development Nanodegree](https://in.udacity.com/google-india-scholarships) program in partnership with [Google (Grow with Google)](https://grow.google/). Below you can find more information.

## Game Instructions
To play the game, use your arrow keys for moving the player across the tiles. Your goal is to cross to the other side of the path without colliding with the *bugs* as many times as possible within thirty seconds. 
More game functionalities and levels will be added as the project develops.
